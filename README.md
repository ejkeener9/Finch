A collection of Java classes written for the Finch robot by Birdbrain Technologies. The projects were originally from

Bare with me as this is still a Work in Progress!

Currently working on writing guides for each of these assignments for students to use later on. It will provide setup information,
clear instructions to complete a version of the assignment, and how long it will take to complete.
